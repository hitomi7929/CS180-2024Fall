# 2024 Fall CS180/280A: Intro to Computer Vision and Computational Photography

CS180/280A aims to introduce students to computational techniques for processing and understanding visual data, including images and videos. The course covers key topics such as image acquisition, representation, and manipulation (image processing), visual analysis and interpretation (computer vision), and image generation (computational photography). It explores both classical algorithms (e.g., Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids) and modern approaches (e.g., convolutional neural networks, GANs), with a strong emphasis on practical application. Through hands-on programming assignments, students will capture their own images and implement image analysis and synthesis tools from the ground up to solve real-world problems.
