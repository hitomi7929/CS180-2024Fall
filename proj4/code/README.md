# 2024 Fall CS180 Project 4

This folder contains five parts:

- `main.ipynb`: All the codes related to this project. Just use "Run All" to reproduce the results!
- `utils.py`: This is my labeling tool. Please run it at first to get your ideal corresponding points. I have also provided for the information of corresponding points in `./media` folder for your convenience.
- `manual_mosaic.py`: Run this to generate the manually stitched results for Part B. I have provided the results in my submission so you could skip this as well.
- `./media`: All the input images, please don't revise it to ensure the codes working correctly.
- `./output`: All the output images generated in this project. Run `main.ipynb` to get them.

Before reproducing by the code, you need to install the following dependencies:

`pip install numpy`
`pip install matplotlib`
`pip install scipy`
`pip install scikit-image`
`pip install opencv-python`
