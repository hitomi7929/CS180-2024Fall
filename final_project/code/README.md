# CS180 Final Project

I choose two pre-canned projects for my final project. Please follow the instruction below to reproduce.

## Gradient Domain Fushion

This project contains the following parts:

- `main.m`: The file you need to run in order to reproduce the results.
- `toy_reconstruct.m`: My implement for *Part 2.1 Toy Problem*.
- `poissonBlend.m`: My implement for *Part 2.2 Poisson Blending*.
- `mixedBlend.m`: My implement for *Bells & Whistles -- Mixed Gradients*.
- `color2gray.m`: My implement for *Bells & Whistles -- Color2Gray*.
- The other *.m* files are the given helper functions.
- Folder `samples`: This folder contains all the input images for this project.
- Folder `output`: This folder contains all the output images. I provide this for your convience to check the output.

To run the code, please include all the related files under the same path and run `main.m` in Matlab. You could also change the parameters to choose the function you would like to test following the guidance in `main.m`.

## Image Quilting

This project contains three parts:

- `main.ipynb`: The code for reproducing the workflow.
- `utils.py`: The given helper code.
- Folder `samples`: This folder contains all the input images for this project.

To reproduce, please upload all the related files above to Google Drive and run `main.ipynb` via Colab.
