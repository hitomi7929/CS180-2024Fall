# 2024 Fall CS180 Project 2

This folder contains four parts:

- `main.ipynb`: All the codes related to this project. Just use "Run All" to reproduce the results!
- `utils.py`: Generate the aligned images used in the **Hybrid Images** part. Please run it at first to get your ideal aligned images. I have also provided some aligned images in `./media` folder for your convenience.
- `./media`: All the input images, please don't revise it to ensure the codes working correctly.
- `./output`: All the output images generated in this project. Run `main.ipynb` to get them.
