# 2024 Fall CS180 Project 3

This folder contains four parts:

- `main.ipynb`: All the codes related to this project. Just use "Run All" to reproduce the results!
- `utils.py`: This is my labeling tool for **Part 1**. Please run it at first to get your ideal corresponding points. I have also provided for the information of corresponding points in `./media` folder for your convenience.
- `./media`: All the input images, please don't revise it to ensure the codes working correctly.
- `./output`: All the output images generated in this project. Run `main.ipynb` to get them.

To reproduce the results, please run the code below at first:

`pip install numpy`
`pip install matplotlib`
`pip install scipy`
`pip install scikit-image`
`pip install ipython`

***IMPORTANT!!!***

I used a freely available dataset of annotated faces for Part 4. You could download it [Here!](https://web.archive.org/web/20070613155122/http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~aam/datasets/imm_face_db.tar.gz) Please download it first and unzip it to the folder `./media/imm_face_db`.
